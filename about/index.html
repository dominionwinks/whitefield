            <p class="wwa-p">
                Whitefield Missions is a mission-based Christian organization with the purpose of raising ministers of the Gospel and
                missionaries in every nation of the world. <br>
                We are persuaded that the instruction of Jesus Christ to Go into all the world and make disciples of all nations implies
                that every believer should be a student of God’s Word who is being trained and taught to be an effective minister of the
                Gospel. We treat this instruction with utmost urgency in our hearts because, as Jesus said, the fields are already white
                for harvest, and the harvest truly is plenty, but the labourers are few.

                We are ever moving with the mandate of raising one million (1 million) missionaries for Jesus in every generation, by
                training and inspiring believers to participate in the work of soul-winning, which we believe is the primary and
                greatest purpose of the Church today.

           <p class="wwa-p">
            To fulfil this vision, we have sought to employ every means within our reach, and as God has led us, to train and
            disciple people to be efficient labourers in the great harvest, while we reach even more with the saving knowledge of
            Jesus Christ. Our various ministry arms are as follows:

                A community set up to mentor and disciple teenagers and secondary school students with the hope of preserving the
                younger generation for the Lord. We know that the seed of God’s Word will have the chance to grow in a heart only when
                it is planted. We claim these young ones early enough for Jesus and rescue those who have been victims of the evils of
                this present age.

            A music-based ministry comprising a team of musicians and song-writers which communicate God’s Word in songs inspired by
            God’s Spirit. Songs are characteristic of the Spirit of the New Creation, and are a reflection of our theology. With our
            songs, more men will be taught and changed by the Gospel of our Lord Jesus and His doctrine.

            video formats, and also with the employment of every form of media to reach men for Jesus. Like the writers of the
            Gospels, we preserve events of God’s working among and through us, while we publish and present the message of the
            Gospel to all the world. <br>
            The LightStream Newsletter is a quarterly publication in print designed primarily to communicate God’s Word to entire
            communities around us, first printed September 2021
